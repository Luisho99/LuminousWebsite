 <p class="design-paragraph">Our Brand focuses on self expression and embracing values like Authenticity, uniqueness and Determination.
We want to give individual pieces of clothing to people to help them express oneself more, regardless of their gender.
Therefore we created a unisex fashion clothing store. We stuck mainly to the brand colors which are Red, Yellow and Grey and implemented those on our website. Talk about what colts transport The exact Hex color code can be found down below. The clothing is mainly about street style hence we focused with our visuals to transport the graffiti urban vibe, that is fitting with our brand.
We want to give our user an easy shopping experience, that starts with our home page. Here will the customer experience the feeling of the brand and will find an easy indication towards the shop, in form of a button. In the shop, The user has an overview over our product, the unique Jackets. A menu on the side is working as filter, where the shop gets ordered after Fit what is in the menu. 
After deciding on a Product that seems interesting, we get to the product page where more information awaits, as well as size choices information about the stock and quantity.<br>
		<br>
If the user decides to put the product into the shopping card, we get to the shopping card section. Here the user sees all thew information about his soon to be purchase, and the quantity as well as the size they decided on. At the botto, the prize will be indicated again as well as a check out button, that directs the customer to the checkout form and payment information.
<br>
<br>
Other then the Shop, we provide information about us, in the ABOUt us section. Here the customer learns about our story and vision, to be more transparent to our clients. It gives better inside in who we are and builds a closer bond with our users. Further down we also have information about ourselves with pictures to give our company a face, to be less anonymous. 
We also talk about our values and what is important to us with our brand. This gives more indication about what the brand is about to help customers understand better.
<br>
<br>				
If there are still questions left or possible feedback wants to be given, we have a contact page. Here the user can write us per email in form of a contact page, to make the process easier. There is also a possibility to call for urgent matters or to follow us on our social media platforms to stay connected. Each page is highlighted in the navigation bar, so the customer knows exactly where they are at the moment.

Prototype home page and prototype about us or store, 
We prototyped our website first on paper before tuning them into code. We changed some minor things with the about page in the form of constellation, but the content is the same.



Testing:
We tested our paper prototype with 5 people in the age from 20 to 26 via Skype interviews. 
they were given the home landing page and were supposed to order a jacket from the shop. 
They all managed to order the jacket and a few went to the about page first to find out more about the brand, before purchasing something from us. They also visited the contact page to see if we have any social media channels that they could visit for more content. 

When we tested with the paper prototype we put the check out basket next to the page the user was on, but we realised it would be better to give it a spot in the navigation bar for an easy access. 
All the testers liked the easy navigation and usability of the website. A few would have liked a bit more filters and a q and A of questions. Look into marketing.
